# DrawboardPDF-Linux
An Electron wrapper for the Drawboard PDF software.







# I am not affiliated with Drawboard PDF
I simply like their software and wanted to be able to run it on Linux, albeit in an electron browser.
Any issues with the app itself should be directed to the Drawboard team - *not to me*
